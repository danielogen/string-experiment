      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this researc is to study string interpolation in  programming languages.</p>
      <h4>Participants</h4>
      <p>You are being asked to participate in the study because you either freshman, sophomore, junior, senior or professional.
      </p>
      <h4>Procedures</h4>
      <p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, you may be asked to do the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read programming languages or abstract code snippets</li>
        <li>Take a survey about string manipulation syntax in programming languages</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Benefits</h4>
      <p>You may learn about programming languages by participating in this study. Other than possibly contributing to scientific knowledge in the field, there are otherwise no benefits for participation.</p>
      <h4>Risks</h4>
      <p>There are risks involved in all research studies and while this study includes only minimal risks, you may experience some mental distress. Many students that are learning to program a computer find the experience challenging. Computer programming can be very mathematical and might require significant effort. Tasks in this study are designed to be very simple (not more than 5 lines of code). Further, the easiest way for us to gather information about how well our tools are working is to do so electronically. While we will do our best to keep all information confidential, and the information we are collecting is not of a personal nature, no computer security mechanism is perfectly secure.</p>
      <h4>Cost/Compensation</h4>
      <p>There will not be any financial cost/compensation to you to participate or for participating in this study.</p>
      <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>All information gathered in this study will be kept as confidential as possible. No reference will be made in written or oral materials that could link you to this study. 
        <!-- All records will be stored in a locked facility at UNLV for 5 years after completion of the study.  Since this study is part     of an international research collaboration, non-identifiable data may also be shared securely to trained research collaborators in the US and Europe. -->
      </p>
      <h4>Voluntary Participation</h4>
      <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate in this study or in any part of this study. You may withdraw at any time without prejudice to your relations with UNLV. You may ask questions about this study at the beginning or any time during the research study.</p>
